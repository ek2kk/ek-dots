# Arch Linux Installation

There are several ways to install Arch. Besides manual installation, these two are recommended:
1. archinstall -> GNOME desktop preset -> manual Hyprland installation besides GNOME. (recommended) 
2. archinstall -> Hyprland desktop preset -> manual installation of some parts.

In case if second one is used, errors may occur because some system parts are not installed.
